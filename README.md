# War-card-game
The War card game is a simple and fun two-player card game that requires no special equipment other than a standard deck of playing cards. The objective of the game is to win all the cards.

Here's how to play the War card game:

1. **Setup**: Shuffle the deck of cards and deal all the cards face-down evenly between the two players. Each player now has their own face-down stack of cards.

2. **Gameplay**: Both players simultaneously reveal the top card from their face-down stack and place it face-up in front of them. The player with the higher card value wins the round and takes both cards, placing them face-down at the bottom of their stack.

3. **Card Values**: In descending order, the card values are ranked as follows (from highest to lowest):
   - Ace (A)
   - King (K)
   - Queen (Q)
   - Jack (J)
   - 10 to 2 (numerical value)

4. **War**: If both players reveal cards of the same value during a round (e.g., both players play a 7), it's called a "war." To resolve a war, both players place three additional cards face-down on top of the initially played card and then reveal a fourth card face-up. The player with the higher value of the fourth card wins all the cards involved in the war. If there is another tie during the war, the process is repeated until one player's revealed card is higher than the other's.

5. **Winning**: The game continues until one player has won all the cards. The player who collects all the cards is the winner.

6. **Note**: If a player runs out of cards to play during a war, they lose the game. The opponent collects all the remaining cards, and the game ends.

The War card game is based largely on luck, as there are no strategic decisions to be made during gameplay. It is often played with children, as it is simple to learn and can be an entertaining way to pass the time. However, it's worth noting that the game can go on for a long time, especially if there are multiple wars.
